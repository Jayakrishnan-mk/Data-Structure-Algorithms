// 0/1 knap sack - geeks for geeks - medium

// Input:  W = 4, profit[] = [1, 2, 3], weight[] = [4, 5, 1]
// Output: 3

// Explanation: There are two items which have weight less than or equal to 4.
// If we select the item with weight 4, the possible profit is 1.
// And if we select the item with weight 1, the possible profit is 3.
// So the maximum possible profit is 3.
// Note that we cannot put both the items with weight 4 and 1 together -
// as the capacity of the bag is 4.
