// Approach - Using dfs algo.........

// pseudocode:
// first make a graph var with making a hashmap
// and loop the prerequisites, and add the course and the prereq to map
// after that, make a state array with numCourses length with filled 0
// then make a recursion fn, and call this with in a for loop
// in that, use condition i < numCourses. and in the loop-
// check, if the course has not been visited- means state[i] === 0,
// call the dfs recursion fn with checking if(!dfs(i)), then return false.
// after the loop, return true.
// in inside the dfs recursion fn, take the params as course.
// and the starting checks of base cases are - 
// if state[course] === 1, return false. 
// if state[course] === 2, return true.
// after these checks, make the state[course] as 1.
// and in an if condition, check this graph has course, then make a for of loop
// to check, the neighbors(prerequisites) of this course.
// and in that condition, call this recursion fn, with checking, if(!dfs(prereq)) return false.
// after that, mark the course as fully processed. means make the state[course] as 2.
// then return true. yes. you're done.ðŸ”¥
